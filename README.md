# genomics

This repo will be based on my previous ccls/sequencing

That repo has gotten way out of hand and as I have moved,
so well might my code.

As needed, scripts from there will be moved, renamed, cleaned
and whatever else might be needed to make it more understandable.






Copy or link Makefile.example to Makefile

make is currently unnecessary as these will just be scripts.
However, make install will copy them to ~/local/bin
or whereever you may have changed BASE_BIN_DIR to be.

make install
