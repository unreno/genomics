Acquire the unmapped bam files for all 1000 genomes subjects.

aws s3 sync s3://1000genomes/phase3/ /raid/data/raw/1000genomes/phase3/ --exclude "*" --include "*/alignment/*.unmapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.*.*.*.bam"


Given the variability of the number of samples and reads for each, we need to try to normalize the results.


Compare aligned reads to ...
* number of unmapped reads.
* number of total reads. (rather than download mapped bam, get mapped bam.bai and use bamReadDepther)

https://github.com/chmille4/bamReadDepther
bamReadDepther returns way more info than needed so need to parse correctly.
A line that begins with a \# is followed by a reference id, mapped and placed-unmapped read counts.
The reference id is relatively useless without the bam file itself.
I believe that it corresponds to the order of @SQ SN number, but need bam files to check.

"Placed-unmapped" reads are unmapped mates of mapped reads.
These should also show in unmapped bam file.
I think that they are only kept in the mapped bam to preserve pairedness.



Let's examine bam counts and bai counts from a mapped file.


The total reads in a bam file ...
samtools view -c NA12878.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam
172724240

The mapped reads in a bai file ...
cat NA12878.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam.bai | bamReadDepther | grep "^#" | awk -F"\t" '{ s+=$2 }END{print s}'
171503169

The placed-unmapped reads in a bai file ...
cat NA12878.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam.bai | bamReadDepther | grep "^#" | awk -F"\t" '{ s+=$3 }END{print s}'
1221071

The total reads in a bai file ...
echo "171503169 + 1221071" | bc
172724240


Are placed-unmapped also in the unmapped file? It does not appear so.


These datasets include both paired and unpaired data.



This doesn't seem to be working for the unmapped bam files?
Ahh. Unmapped is a bit different. Sad face.
This line begins with a \* and only one number. Super sad.
Inconsistancy. Perhaps I should edit code.


Not sure what "placed-unmapped" means in the unmapped file.
Confused.
Viewing unmapped file, but the columns contain positions and good CIGAR strings, but flag says unmapped.
Apparently, this is/was a bwa bug. Data not cleared from previous alignment. Ignoring.


cat NA12878.unmapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam.bai | bamReadDepther | grep "^*\|^#"
#23	0	2
#24	0	25
#84	0	2
*		8272866

So 

cat NA12878.unmapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam.bai | bamReadDepther | grep "^*\|^#" | awk -F"\t" '{s+=$NF}END{print s}'
8272895
samtools view -c NA12878.unmapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam
8272895

Redesigned to align to all virii after HG00733.
Perhaps remove all products based on alignment from HG00[0-7]* and rerun that too.

Reads are 90 bases
.1*90 =9
4=-36.4 - LESS ALIGNMENTS
5=-45.5
6=-54.6
7=-63.7 - MORE ALIGNMENTS
