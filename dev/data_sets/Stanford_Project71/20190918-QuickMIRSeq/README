cat *.fastq | paste - - - - | cut -f 2 | awk '{print length($0)}' | uniq -c

All reads are fairly uniq, so QuickMIRSeq fails





Join lanes and try again
seq 1 77 > allIDs.txt

\rm sample.annotation.txt

Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at
	/home/jake/.local/QuickMIRSeq/QuickMIRSeq.pl line 1533 (#2)
