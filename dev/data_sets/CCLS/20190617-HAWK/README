439338 and 634370 appear to be female
63185, 268325 and 983899 appear to be male
Change U to M or F in gwas_info.txt (sample ends in 8 or 0)

This is all expecting "Case" and "Control".




The current version of jellyfish (2.2.4) never finishes.
Finishes quickly and cleanly, but actually is incomplete? And unclear. No error.

Trying the included modified version 1.1.6.

nohup ./countKmers &

kmers are integer representations? why? memory?
values aren't just 0,1,2 or 3 as suggested?
Is it quaternary converted to decimal?

Is this the "modified" that the repo refers to?
Results very different than that initial test?

New jellyfish doesn't read old format

jellyfish dump -c 122997_kmers_jellyfish | head
Unknown format ''





the 2 log_reg_c*.R scripts should be 1 that take command line options?




mv countKmers.* [469]* 26* case* control* GM_* gwas_* log_eigen.txt pcs.evec pvals_c* runHawk.* sorted_files.txt total_kmer* 20190628-only-Q40-reads-in-bams/

perhaps don't use the canonical flag when extracting from bam?

nohup ./countKmers > countKmers.out 2>&1 &

nohup ./runHawk > runHawk.out 2>&1 &
