Sadly, comes down with all of the alternate chromosomes and chr prefix


noalt.num

changed chrM to chrMT
Removed all lines with an _ to get rid of the alternates
removed the ^chr prefix



Also unsorted

mv genes.raw.bed genes.raw.unsorted.bed
bedtools sort -i genes.raw.unsorted.bed > genes.raw.bed


Need to index before annotating which needs to be bgzipped (NOT gzipped?) first

bgzip genes.raw.bed 
tabix -p bed genes.raw.bed.gz
