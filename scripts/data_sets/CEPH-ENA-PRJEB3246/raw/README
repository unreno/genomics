We are providing deep whole genome sequence data for the CEPH 1463 family in order to create a "platinum" standard comprehensive set of variant calls. These genomes include a trio (NA12877 NA12878 and NA12882) sequenced to greater than 200x depth of coverage, as well as a technical replicate (separate library and sequencing, but same DNA sample) of NA12882 also sequenced to greater than 200x. Additional information and analyses will be provided at www.platinumgenomes.org.
